# Raycast Extension for n8n

A Raycast extension that provides quick access to your n8n workflows and data transformation tools. 

## Overview

I built this extension for Raycast to make it easier for me to search for workflows. I have been adding new commands as needed to speed up my n8n development. Please let me know if there is a feature you would like to add.


## Current Commands

- Search and browse workflows with tag filtering
- Create new workflows
- Convert JSON and manual mappings
- Create and parse webhooks

## Development Setup
I have not submitted this to the Raycast store yet so you will need to run it from your local environment.  

1. Clone the repo

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
